# Denicek

Denicek is a computational substrate for document-oriented end user programming.
It simplifies the implementation of programming experiences including 
collaborative source code editing, programming by demonstration, incremental
recomputation, schema change control, end-user debugging and concrete programming.

Denicek represents a program as a series of edits that construct and transform a 
document consisting of data and formulas. Denicek provides three operations on edit 
histories: edit application, merging of histories and conflict resolution.
The above programming experiences can be easily implemented by composing these 
three operations.
